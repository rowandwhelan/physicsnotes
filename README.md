Prompt:
Make me a site that will take 5 minutes to set up and host on vercel that will have a super clean design, one click copy (maybe even different formats) and will have a smart search feature and self ordering and reranking/grouping/labeling of common math and physics constants and equations, use these as a starting point: https://courses.physics.illinois.edu/phys101/sp2025/formula_sheet.pdf https://cdn.static.fykos.cz/physics-brawl-online-2024/konstantovnik_en.pdf Keep it for general calcuations and up to physics 1-2 level and practical. Also make a way to add extra formulas, not sure how you changes would be saved but make it happen.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
